        <h2>Reginald Fessenden - The Sonar, 1912.</h2>

        <p style="width: max-content;">
          Reginald Fessenden began his career for transmitting sound through the air, </br>
          but he gained his reputation for transmitting it through water. Having signed </br>
          a contract to deliver a hydrophone, he instead made a transducer that could </br>
          both send and receive sound data. According to the Science History Institute </br>
          website, he called it “the Fessenden oscillator, lest anyone forget its </br>
          origin.” This device looked like a loudspeaker, and it could be attached to </br>
          a ship or placed directly in the water. It worked by creating sounds and then </br>
          identifying sounds that came back in the same frequency. The Science History </br>
          Institute website describes an early test of the sonor device taking place </br>
          when it was dropped into cold water at a depth of 10 feet to identify ice </br>
          with Fessenden holding a stopwatch. After the power was turned on and the </br>
          oscillator generated its sound, “The ping sped through the frigid seawater at </br>
          about 4,800 feet per second: at 540 hertz it was about the same pitch as a dial </br>
          tone—but loud. The sound waves hit the iceberg, refracting at different angles. </br>
          A little more than a second later the echo returned to the oscillator, cuing </br>
          Fessenden to stop the watch.” By calculating the speed of sound through the water </br>
          and the length of time it took for the ping to go out and return, it was now </br>
          possible to identify the distance of underwater objects from the boats that need.

        >
        <p style="width: max-content; float: right;">
          Walkie-talkies require a speaker and a microphone, but in some devices</br>
          the speaker can be used as a microphone. Since walkie-talkies use</br>
          radio frequencies to communicate, they require an antenna. Users need</br>
          to push a button to turn the device into a transmitter in order to</br>
          talk and can receive messages when the device is a receiver. With</br>
          half-duplex walkie talkies, it is only possible to have one person to</br>
          transmit at a time, though many people can receive the communication.</br>
          With full-duplex walkie talkies or two-way radios it is possible to</br>
          transmit and receive at the same time. </br> </br>
          Walkie-talkies were used effectively during World War II when tens of </br>
          thousands of models weremanufactured and shipped worldwide. The Model </br>
          C-58 Pack Set wasespecially popular. According to the website </br>
          twoway-radio.com it“included a range of antennas and power supplies, </br>
          voice scramblers toprotect privacy and enhance security and even a </br>
          filter to removebattle noises from communications so messages could be </br>
          received loudand clear even during gunfire and engine noise.”

        <h2>Archie, First internet search engine – Alan Emtage, 1990.</h2>

        <p style="width: max-content;">
          The search engine Archie was made in 1990 by Alan Emtage, Bill Heelan</br>
          and Peter Deutsch at McGill University in Montreal. It had very narrow</br>
          search parameters and it looks nothing like the search engines that we</br>
          use daily. According to the website Stackscale, the name “Archie comes</br>
          from the word ‘Archive,’” but it has also been “associated with the</br>
          Archie comics.” It was an index of FTP files and allowed users to look</br>
          around the internet in a limited way. This engine could make simple</br>
          requests for searching files, which had to be downloaded to see if</br>
          they were the correct files. It could only recognize the titles of</br>
          files or certain terms. By 1993, acoording to Stackscale, Archie “had</br>
          about 50k queries per day and a few thousand users around the world.”</br>
          Search engines have expanded and upgraded over time making it easy and</br>
          quick to let users have a good experience. Archie made it easier for</br>
          more advanced search engines to be made. Most of those search engines</br>
          use many techniques developed in the creation of Archie, and “The</br>
          University of Warsaw in Poland still maintains an active legacy Archie</br>
          server.”

        <h2>Java coding Language – James Gosling, 1995.</h2>
        <img>
        <p style="width: max-content; float: right">
          Java is one of the world's most popular programming languages. It is</br>
          used in almost every piece of software we use today. Did you know that</br>
          James Gosling, the creator of Java, is Canadian? When Gosling began</br>
          working on Java in June 1991, his main goal was to create and maintain</br>
          a virtual machine and language with a well-known notation like C but</br>
          more precise and simpler to use. According to the Jigsaw website, “In</br>
          1995, Java 1.0 was the first public version of the language. Its motto</br>
          was Write Once, run anywhere.” Some of the benefits of Java is that it</br>
          was very safe to use. Soon, the leading web browsers started to</br>
          include it in their standards. Today, Google recommends that android</br>
          app developers use Java to build their apps or games. It allows web</br>
          developers to make projects with APIs without adding extra code.</br>
          Having become open source, Java has continued to develop thanks to the</br>
          community and oracle. Java is the framework for programming most</br>
          software in 2022, including this website.</br>

        <p style="width: max-content; ">
          Research In Motion (RIM) introduced the BlackBerry mobile device in</br>
          February 1999. The BlackBerry served as a mobile phone as well as a</br>
          system for e-mail delivery. What made the BlackBerry special was that</br>
          e-mail messages were pushed from the user’s computer or corporate</br>
          server—including the BlackBerry Enterprise server—to the user’s</br>
          BlackBerry without them needing to dial in to retrieve messages. This</br>
          meant that the BlackBerry was always connected when it was turned on,</br>
          and there was no need to turn it off. The BlackBerry predated the</br>
          iPhone, so its closest competitor in the category of mobile e-mail</br>
          devices was the Palm VII PDA, which cost $599 compared to $399 for the</br>
          BlackBerry. While both devices included an address book, calendar,</br>
          task list, and alarm clock features, the BlackBerry notified users of</br>
          new messages while the Palm VII did not. When it was introduced, the</br>
          BlackBerry had its service provide by BellSouth's wireless network in</br>
          the United States and the Cantel AT&T wireless data network in Canada,</br>
          and the monthly service charge was $40.
